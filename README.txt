# Sidikjari

A modern implementation of the FOCA (Fingerprinting Organizations with Collected Archives) tool written in Python.

## Overview

Sidakjari is a powerful security tool designed to extract metadata from documents publicly available on websites. It helps security professionals and penetration testers identify potential information leakage in an organization's public documents.

The tool:
- Crawls websites to find documents (PDFs, Office documents, images, etc.)
- Downloads these documents for analysis
- Extracts metadata including usernames, emails, software versions, etc.
- Identifies internal domain names, IP addresses, and system information
- Generates detailed reports of all findings

## Features

- **Document Discovery**: Crawls target websites to find documents
- **Metadata Extraction**: Extracts valuable metadata from multiple file formats:
  - PDF
  - Microsoft Office (DOCX, XLSX, PPTX)
  - Images (JPEG, PNG, GIF)
  - XML, CSV
- **Information Analysis**: Identifies and correlates:
  - Usernames and email addresses
  - Internal domain names
  - IP addresses and network information
  - Software versions and configurations
  - File paths and server names
- **Reporting**: Generates comprehensive reports of all findings
- **Local Analysis**: Can analyze both websites and local document collections
