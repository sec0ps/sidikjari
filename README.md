![Sidikjari Logo](https://redcellsecurity.org/assets/sidikjari_logo.png)

## Overview

Sidikjari is a powerful Python-based metadata extraction and analysis tool designed for cybersecurity professionals, penetration testers, and security researchers. It crawls websites to discover documents, extracts comprehensive metadata from various file types, and generates detailed reports highlighting potential security risks and information leakage.

Sidikjari helps identify sensitive information that might be unintentionally exposed in document metadata, which could be leveraged during security assessments or by malicious actors.

## Key Features

- **Website Crawling**: Recursively crawls websites to discover documents at a configurable depth
- **Document Download**: Automatically downloads discovered documents for detailed analysis
- **Comprehensive Metadata Extraction**: Extracts metadata from multiple document types:
  - PDF files
  - Microsoft Office documents (DOCX, XLSX, PPTX)
  - Image files (JPG, JPEG, PNG, GIF)
  - CSV files
- **Multi-threaded Processing**: Performs concurrent operations for faster analysis
- **Detailed Reports**: Generates comprehensive HTML reports including:
  - Document metadata summaries
  - User/author identification
  - Software identification
  - Domain and email intelligence
  - GPS location mapping (for documents with geolocation data)
  - Interactive relationship graphs
  - SSL certificate analysis
  - Website screenshots
- **Local File Analysis**: Can analyze local directories of files instead of crawling websites
- **WHOIS Integration**: Collects domain registration information
- **IP Intelligence**: Gathers details about discovered IP addresses
- **Customizable User-Agent**: Allows specification of browser type for web requests
- **Request Throttling**: Configurable time delay between requests to avoid overwhelming servers

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- ExifTool (must be installed and available in PATH)
- Various Python libraries (see requirements section)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone [https://github.com/redcellsecurity/sidikjari.git](https://github.com/sec0ps/sidikjari)
cd sidikjari
```

2. Install required Python dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Install ExifTool:
   - Windows: Download from https://exiftool.org/ and add to PATH
   - macOS: `brew install exiftool`
   - Linux: `apt-get install exiftool` or equivalent

4. For screenshot functionality (optional):
```
pip install selenium webdriver-manager
```

## Usage

### Analyze a Website

```
python sidikjari.py --url example.com --output results --depth 2 --threads 10
```

### Analyze Local Files

```
python sidikjari.py --local /path/to/documents --output results --threads 10
```

### Command Line Options

- `--url`, `-u`: Target URL to scan
- `--output`, `-o`: Output directory (default: "output")
- `--depth`, `-d`: Crawl depth (0=homepage only, 1=direct links, etc.)
- `--threads`, `-t`: Number of concurrent threads (default: 10)
- `--local`, `-l`: Local directory of files to analyze (instead of URL)
- `--time-delay`: Delay in seconds between web requests (default: 0.0)
- `--user-agent`: User agent type to use ("default", "chrome", "firefox", "safari", "edge", "mobile", or "random")

## Report Features

The HTML report generated by Sidikjari includes:

- **Domain Information**: Registration details, WHOIS data
- **SSL Certificate Analysis**: Validation, algorithms, expiration, security assessment
- **Document Metadata**: Comprehensive details extracted from each document
- **Discovered Information**: Users, email addresses, internal paths, software versions
- **Interactive Maps**: Visual representation of GPS coordinates found in documents
- **Relationship Graphs**: Interactive visualization of connections between discovered entities
- **Website Screenshots**: Visual capture of the target website

## Examples

### Basic Website Scan
```
python sidikjari.py --url targetcompany.com
```

### Deep Website Scan with Delay
```
python sidikjari.py --url targetcompany.com --depth 3 --time-delay 0.5 --user-agent random
```

### Local Document Analysis
```
python sidikjari.py --local /path/to/client/documents --threads 20
```
